            <p>Taylor is the "techie" who loves learning about web development and using technologies to solve real life problems. With a Masters degree in counseling psychology and a lot of experience in social work as a caseworker, Taylor has used technology as a remedy and resource for a lot of issues.</p>
            <p>Taylor first became interested in web development at his church when the previous person who ran the website left. Taylor volunteered to learn and soon found that building and maintaining websites was a lot of fun. Now instead of just learning about simple Wordpress websites or basic HTML, he's learning how to be build entire web applications</p>

        <h2>Why You Should Work With Us</h2>
        <h5>We're not your typical "tech" people.</h5>
        <p>We won't talk to you about Javascript frameworks or [insert random tech term here] and expect you to care or understand anything about it. We went to school to learn how to talk, and more importantly, how to <i>listen</i> to people.</p>
        <h5>You need to be online.</h5>
        <p>Maybe you've been doing ok with what you've got or without a website until now but the truth is you're missing out on customers without some sort of digital storefront. This gives customers an opportunity to learn more about you at their own pace. You know you need a website, a Facebook page, or maybe just a site revamp but you don't know or care too much about the details - you just know you don't want to have to do it yourself. Let us help!</p>
